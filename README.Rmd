#### Scenario projections of RSV hospitalizations averted due to new immunization programs in King County, Washington, October 2023 to May 2025


This work was done in collaboration with Public Health - Seattle & King County as part of a CSTE/CDC - supported initiative, "Development of forecast, analytic, and visualization tools to improve outbreak response and support public health decision making."

Please see our [Pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.13.24319008v1) and documentation for our R Package [R.Scenario.Vax](https://chelsea-hansen.github.io/R.Scenario.Vax/) For more information regarding the model structure.

We used RSV hospitalization data for the greater Seattle area from two sources:

1. For age groups ≥10 years, we used RSV-diagnosed hospital admissions among King County residents or at King County hospitals from [Washington State’s syndromic surveillance platform](https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-provider-resources/healthcare-professions-and-facilities/data-exchange/syndromic-surveillance-rhino). 
2. For children <10 years, we used RSV hospitalizations with a positive RSV test (during or preceding admission) seen at [Seattle Children’s Hospital](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/) for the same period.

Immunization data was obtained from [Washington State Immunization Information System](https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-provider-resources/healthcare-professions-and-facilities/data-exchange/immunization-information-system)

**Note:** Raw data are not publicly available. Aggregated datasets have been provided here to reproduce our study results. Researchers wishing to access Washington’s syndromic surveillance data should contact [RHINO@doh.wa.gov](RHINO@doh.wa.gov). 
Researchers wishing to access aggregate data from Seattle Children’s Hospital should contact [amanda.adler@seattlechildrens.org](amanda.adler@seattlechildrens.org) for information on data sharing agreements. Researchers wishing to access data from Washington's Immunization Information System from  should contact [WAIISDataRequests@doh.wa.gov](WAIISDataRequests@doh.wa.gov).

## Data

#### Calibration datasets and parameter values

- `time_series_public.rds`: Time series of weekly RSV hospitalization rate per 100,000 population in King County, WA. These data have been adjusted to account for changes in RSV testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a 3-week moving average has been applied. For more information, see the eMethods from the corresponding manuscript.
- `age_distribution_public.rds`: Age distribution of RSV hospitalizations in King County, WA.
- `weekly_immunizations_public.rds`:Estimated weekly and cumulative immunization coverage for:
  - Infants born to vaccinated mothers.
  - Infants receiving birth doses of nirsevimab.
  - Infants receiving catch-up doses of nirsevimab.
  - Adults ≥60 years receiving RSV vaccines.
- `fixed_parameters.rds`: Fixed parameter values for running the model. These values are taken from previous modeling studies and publicly available census data:
  - `[[1]]`: Fixed parameter values (see eTable 2 of the manuscript for full list).
  - `[[2]]`: Starting values for model compartments, based on publicly available age-stratified census data (vector form).
  - `[[3]]`: Starting values for model compartments, based on publicly available age-stratified census data (matrix form).
- `fitted_paramaters.rds`: Fitted parameter values for 100 model trajectories (saved from MLE code).

## R 

#### R Scripts for fitting model parameters and running scenario projections. 

- `MLE.R`: R function for fitting parameter values using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
- `MSIRS_immunization_dynamics.R`: Differential equations describing the transmission dynamics of RSV.
- `projection_function.R`: Function to produce scenario projections.
- `Projections_2023_24.R`: Application of `projection_function.R` to scenarios for the 2023–2024 RSV season.
- `Projections_2024_25.R`: Application of `projection_function.R` to scenarios for the 2024–2025 RSV season.

## Results

#### 100 Trajectories of RSV Hospitalizations for each Scenario

- `results_23-24_100replicates`: Scenario projections for the 2023–2024 RSV season.
- `results_24-25_100replicates`: Scenario projections for the 2024–2025 RSV season.
